Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: &amp;ldquo;start free trial&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;access course materials&amp;rdquo;. If the student clicks &amp;ldquo;start free trial&amp;rdquo;, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course.</description>

 #Analyzing Results
Sanity checks check invariant metrics
 population sizing metrics based on unit of diversion: experiment population and control population is comparable other metrics that should not change in experiments  Choosing Invariants   Quiz: (choose the invariant metrics, that is, choose the metrics that would be the same in experiment and control group)
 1st: user-id is the unit of diversion, so #signed in users are random in experiment group and control groups.</description>

 #Design an Experiment
Choose &amp;ldquo;subject&amp;rdquo; Unit of diversion What an individual subject is in the experiment.
Unit of diversion examples:   commonly used:
  user id
  stable, unchanging
  personally identifiable
    Anonymous id (cookie)
 changes when switching browser or device users can clear cookies    Event
 no consistent experience use only for non-user-visible changes      less common:</description>

      <description>Course note of A/B testing on Udacity: Lesson 3
 Choosing and Characterizing metrics   Two types of metrics and their use cases:
 invariant checking/sanity checking metrics: metrics should not change across the experiment and the control. For example, the number of users in two groups in experiment and do they have the same distribution, like country, age, etc. For sanity checking may use multiple metrics evaludation metrics: high-level business metrics+detail metrics.</description>

      <description>Course note of A/B testing on Udacity: Lesson 2
 Policy and Ethics for Experiments Main principles 1. Risk  what risk is the participant undertaking? The main threshold is whether the risk exceeds that of “minimal risk”. Minimal risk is defined as the probability and magnitude of harm that a participant would encounter in normal daily life. The harm considered encompasses physical, psychological and emotional, social, and economic concerns. If the risk exceeds minimal risk, then informed consent is required.</description>
